# Template Generation and Customization

The Somnia GameKit SDK includes functionality for generating pre-built smart contract templates for different types of games and customizing them to fit specific requirements.

## Template Generation

The `generateContractTemplate` function creates pre-built smart contract templates for specific types of games:

```javascript
// Generate a template for a turn-based game
const template = sdk.generateContractTemplate('turn-based', {
  maxPlayers: 2,
  winCondition: 'rock-paper-scissors'
});
```

## Template Customization

The `customizeContract` function allows you to customize pre-built templates to fit specific game requirements:

```javascript
// Customize the template with additional game rules
const customizedContract = sdk.customizeContract(template, {
  customLogic: 'additional game rules'
});
```

## Development Environment

The SDK also provides tools for setting up a local development environment, running tests, and debugging contracts:

```javascript
// Set up a local development environment
sdk.setupLocalEnvironment();

// Run tests for game contracts
sdk.runTests(contractAddress);

// Debug game contracts
sdk.debugContract(contractAddress);
```

## Documentation and Support

Comprehensive documentation and community support are available:

```javascript
// Generate documentation for the SDK
sdk.generateDocumentation();

// Access community forums and support channels
sdk.joinCommunity();
```
